# Artificial intelligence and digital tools for assisting low carbon architectural design. 

## Merging the use of Machine Learning, Large Language Models and Building Information Modelling for LCA tool development.

The construction sector significantly contributes to global carbon emissions and the consumption of non-renewable resources. Architectural design decisions play a critical role in the  building's carbon footprint, making essential  the incorporation of environmental analyses at various design stages l. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) can support  designers to achieve low-carbon architectural design. The proposed solution is managed through the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. Article focuses on merging Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies to optimise the environmental impact of architectural projects. The case studies section presents specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first case study details a machine learning-assisted tool for estimating carbon footprints during the design phase. The second case study explores the use of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest optimizations in architectural design. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a comprehensive 3D application, emphasising the importance of AI in enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.
